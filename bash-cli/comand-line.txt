Listing as tree
```````````````

    npm -ls --depth 0   #list install module in current dir



Create relative symlink directory
`````````````````````````````````
    1. go to the directory you want the link-dir to reside in
    2. ln -s ../some/other/sourceDir/  linkedDir
       or
       ln -s ../some/other/sourceDir  linkedDir

       but not
           ln -s ../some/other/sourceDir  linkedDir/

       very useful:
           ln -s ../node_modules node_modules



Create absolute symlink file
````````````````````````````
    1. go to the directory you want the link to reside in
    2. ln -s ~/path/to/sourcefile.js

    If the link file name is different from source file:
    2. ln -s ~/path/to/sourceFile.js linkedFile.js



Copy folder with symbolic content
`````````````````````````````````
  • Copy folder and its contents, if the content is a symbolic
    link, do not dereference:
  • If the folder source/ is a symbolic link dereference
    the folder:

        cp -R -H source/ dest/


  • Copy folder and its contents, if the content is a symbolic link
    dereference it by copy the content the reference point to:

        cp -R -L source/ dest/
