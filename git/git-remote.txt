Determine the URL that a local Git repository was originally cloned from



  There are at least four ways:

    Least information:

      $ git config --get remote.origin.url      // If referential integrity has been broken
      $ git ls-remote --get-url


    More information:

      $ git remote -v

    Even more information:

      $ git remote show origin                  // If referential integrity is intact
