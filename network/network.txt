::: To figure out the ip of your machine

    Unix:
        ifconfig | grep inet.
    Window:
        ipconfig

    Better solution for Mac/Unix:

      ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1

      The command removes the 127.0.0.1 entry, which will always appear regardless
      of the machine you are using. This is the feedback loop
      and can be ignored when looking for the IP address.


::: To verify a port has been taken

    netstat -na | grep 8080.
    # If thereâ€™s something running in the port 8080, it should display a message.


::: Find the process id tie to particular port

    The PID is the second field in the output.
        $ lsof -n -i4TCP:8080

    Or try:
        $lsof -i -P
